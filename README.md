# PRESENTATION-Entrainment-Anne-van-Leeuwen
Entrainment experiment also known as the experiment 'Ritme4'. Participant is shown a visual representation of an conversation while hearing two snippits. Participant is then asked to rate a feature of the conversation.

Experiment heavily relies on a correctly configured `.txt file` wherein every trial takes up two lines: one for the first part of the dialogue and the other for the second part.

Important: in order to have the experiment send out trigger one needs to set the `write_codes` to `true` in the scenario file.

# Features
* Uses finely tunned triggers
* Builds each visual representation based on trial parameters (old versions used preconfigured pictures)
